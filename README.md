# One Minute Challenge

**One Minute Challenge** is my first game development project, designed to explore core game engine mechanics and real-time gameplay systems.

## Overview
A Unity-based game where players complete short, time-limited challenges within one minute. This project served as a hands-on learning experience in game development, including gameplay logic, scene management, input handling, timers, UI systems, game state control, and audio integration.

The game has been successfully published on the **Microsoft Store**, providing my first full-cycle experience in designing, developing, and releasing a game.

## Features
- Time-limited challenges: Players must complete objectives within one minute.
- Real-time gameplay mechanics: Implemented using Unity’s game loop and C# scripts.
- Player input handling: Keyboard and mouse controls for responsive interaction.
- Scene & UI management: Dynamic scene transitions and responsive UI elements.
- Audio integration: Background music and sound effects to enhance user experience.
- Game state control: Pause, restart, and score management systems.

## Tech Stack
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Platform:** Windows (Microsoft Store)
- **Development Tools:** Unity Editor, Visual Studio
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of Unity game loop and event-driven programming.
- Hands-on experience with scene management and UI systems.
- Integration of audio for immersive gameplay.
- Exposure to end-to-end game development workflow: development, testing, and deployment.
